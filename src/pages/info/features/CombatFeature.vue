<h1>Combat</h1>
<p>Obvious as it might be, it bears mentioning that Irkala is not a particularly peaceful place. Your companion can and probably will get involved into fights without their mom getting scared and saying they're moving with their uncle and their auntie on Bel Air.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Combat in Irkala is a simple turn based affair. You will be able to choose between regular attack, special attack and defense. As your companion grows, it may learn something more to offer in combat, or a different spin on the regular commands. </p>
<p>Enemies range from easy enough that you can take on a few of them one after another to more dangerous affairs that demand some prior knowledge and preparation to prevail against.</p>
<p>You don't really need to fight the hardest enemies to complete the game, but the more dangerous the challenge, the better the reward offered will be. For all we know, this might also apply to the ending...</p>
