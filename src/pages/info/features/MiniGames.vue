<h1>Minigames</h1>
<p>Simply clicking on buttons and reading text and watching numbers go up would be....I was going to say boring, but idling and clicking is an entire genre nowadays so what do I know? But truth to be told, I'd dislike it.</p>
<p>Therefore, apart of obvious things like combat, some other tasks with your companion such as feeding will take the form of minigames.</p>
<p>At least, this is what I intend. Truth to be told, I barely know what I'm doing and chances are I'll give up on this. But in the meantime, let's live the dream, baby! Woo! Minigames!</p>
