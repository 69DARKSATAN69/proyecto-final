<h1>Public Ranking</h1>
<p>Okay, so that is a lie. It's not actually ranking.</p>
<p>Once your playthrough is over, whichever way it ended, you can upload it to this website (it will be in the 'Playthroughs' section) to show everybody else just how amazing your companion is/was that time.</p>
<p>It's not like there's a right way to do things, but it's always neat to show other people what you're up to, no?</p>
