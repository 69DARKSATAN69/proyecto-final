<h1>RPG Elements</h1>
<p>Blah blah blah just a prototype blah blah temper expectations and so on.</p>
<p>Your companion has a set of attributes that affect how it interacts with the world around it. Mainly, how it interacts violently since they mostly affect combat. They are increased (and sometimes decreased) via training, eating and items.</p>
<p>There is a modest amount of equipment available alongside regular consumable items. At the point of writing I haven't begun coding the important stuff yet, 
    but the idea is to create a system to randomize item stats and quality so that there is a decent amount of variety in the rewards attained..</p>
<p>Ideally, and this might just be myself channeling Peter Molyneux however, there will also be special equipment that is head and shoulders above the rest. Think artifacts, legendaries and such.</p>
<p>Other than what I just mentioned, you will also be able to explore Irkala to find things to do in different locales with different events happening in each place and of course, the threat of different enemies.</p>
